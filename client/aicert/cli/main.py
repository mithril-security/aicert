"""AICert CLI

CLI tool for certified builds and deployments

Typical workflow:
1. use new subcommand to set up a configuration
2. modify the configuration to suit your needs
3. use build subcommand to run the build on an
   aicert runner and get back your build
   artifacts and an attestation
4. if your configuration file specifies a serve
   section, the correponding server (whose code
   is now attested) will be launched by the runner
5. verify the attestation

AICert can be run:
- either locally in simulation mode, in which case
  youn need no daemon but a running instance of the
  aicert server (use the aicert-server package)
- either on Azure CVMs, in which case you need to setup
  a local daemon to interact with Azure
  (use the aicert-daemon package)

See the aicert-common package for more on the configuration file.
